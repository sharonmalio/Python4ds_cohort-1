# Going through the Python for Data Science Handbook

1. Fork and clone the Python4ds_cohort-1 repository provided to your computer.
2. Make a topic branch. In your github form, keep the master branch clean. When you create a branch, it essentially will be a copy of the master.

> Pull all changes, make sure your repository is up to date

```
$cd Python4ds_cohort-1
$git pull origin master
```
> Create a new branch as follows -> git checkout-b[Your_slack user name], e.g

```
$git checkout -b yourslackusername master
```

> See all branches created

```
$git branch
* yourslackusername
  master
```
> Push the new branch to github

```
$git push origin -u youremail@gmail.com
```

3. **Remember to only make changes to the Fork!**

Edit the **[Log.md file](https://github.com/Python-4-DS/Cohort-1/blob/master/log.md)** in the repository to update your progress and give links to any code that you have written.

4. Commit the changes to your fork
